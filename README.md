# Pyramid Pattern Printer

This C program prints a right-aligned half-pyramid of hashes (`#`) based on the height input provided by the user.

## Overview

The user is prompted to enter a positive integer (height), and the program prints a pyramid of that height using spaces and hash symbols. This exercise is commonly seen in CS50 and similar introductory programming courses.

## Example Output

If the user inputs `4`, the output will be:
`   #`
`  ##`
` ###`
`####`
